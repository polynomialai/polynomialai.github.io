# API Authentication

**Save your API quota from illegal access.**

- It's critical to not only identify who's using your applications, but also to keep your resources safe from illegal access. 
- During the Agent creation process, Lens Agent generates a unique Agent ID and Access Key, which is used to authenticate the API by sending it in the request header.
